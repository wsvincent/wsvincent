### Hi, I'm Will.

I'm a Developer Advocate at JetBrains working on [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), a Python IDE for data science and web development. 

I like to code and teach, especially around web development with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). Previously I was on the [Django Board](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/) and I've written three books on Django, available either [in print](https://www.amazon.com/stores/William-S.-Vincent/author/B07B38Y8SG) or online at [LearnDjango.com](https://learndjango.com). I also co-host the [Django Chat podcast](https://djangochat.com) and co-write the [Django News newsletter](https://django-news.com).

Most of my Django-related content is on [LearnDjango.com](https://learndjango.com) and I also write [on my personal blog](https://wsvincent.com) from time to time.
